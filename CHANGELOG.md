# Changelog
## In-dev - version TBC
### Added:
- Setting `#[deprecated]` attribute will now cause generated schemas to have the `deprecated` property set to `true`

## [0.7.4] - 2020-05-16
### Added:
- If a struct is annotated with `#[serde(deny_unknown_fields)]`, generated schema will have `additionalProperties` set to `false` (https://github.com/GREsau/schemars/pull/30)
- Set `type` property to `string` on simple enums (https://github.com/GREsau/schemars/issues/28)

## [0.7.3] - 2020-05-15
### Added:
- `#[schemars(schema_with = "...")]` attribute can be set on variants and fields. This allows you to specify another function which returns the schema you want, which is particularly useful on fields of types that don't implement the JsonSchema trait (https://github.com/GREsau/schemars/issues/15)

### Fixed
- `#[serde(with = "...")]`/`#[schemars(with = "...")]` attributes on enum variants are now respected
- Some compiler errors generated by schemars_derive should now have more accurate spans

## [0.7.2] - 2020-04-30
### Added:
- Enable deriving JsonSchema on adjacent tagged enums (https://github.com/GREsau/schemars/issues/4)

## [0.7.1] - 2020-04-11
### Added:
- Added `examples` (https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-handrews-json-schema-validation-02#section-9.5) to `Metadata`

### Fixed
- Fixed a bug in schemars_derive causing a compile error when the `default`, `skip_serializing_if`, and `serialize_with`/`with` attributes are used together (https://github.com/GREsau/schemars/issues/26)

## [0.7.0] - 2020-03-24
### Changed:
- **BREAKING CHANGE** - `SchemaSettings` can no longer be created using struct initialization syntax. Instead, if you need to use custom schema settings, you can use a constructor function and either:
    - assign it to a `mut` variable and modify its public fields
    - call the `with(|s| ...)` method on the settings and modify the settings inside the closure/function (as in the custom_settings.rs example)
### Fixed:
- When deriving `JsonSchema` on structs, `Option<T>` struct fields are no longer included in the list of required properties in the schema (https://github.com/GREsau/schemars/issues/11)
- Fix deriving `JsonSchema` when a non-std `String` type is in scope (https://github.com/GREsau/schemars/pull/19)
- This will now compile: `#[schemars(with="()")]`
### Added:
- Added `allow_ref_siblings` setting to `SchemaSettings`. When enabled, schemas with a `$ref` property may have other properties set.
- Can create JSON Schema 2019-09 schemas using `SchemaSettings::draft2019_09()` (which enables `allow_ref_siblings`)

## [0.6.5] - 2019-12-29
### Added:
- Implemented `JsonSchema` on types from `smallvec` and `arrayvec` (as optional dependencies)

## [0.6.4] - 2019-12-27
### Added:
- Implemented `JsonSchema` on types from `indexmap`, `either` and `uuid` (as optional dependencies)
### Changed
- Remove trait bounds from Map/Set JsonSchema impls. They are unnecessary as we never create/use any instances of these types.

## [0.6.3] - 2019-12-27
- No actual code changes - this version was just published to fix broken README on crates.io

## [0.6.2] - 2019-12-27
### Added:
- Documentation website available at https://graham.cool/schemars/!
### Changed:
- Rename `derive_json_schema` to `impl_json_schema`. `derive_json_schema` is still available for backward-compatibility, but will be removed in a future version.
- Improve schema naming for deriving on remote types. A `#[serde(remote = "Duration")]` attribute is now treated similarly to `#[serde(rename = "Duration")]`.
- Ensure root schemas do not have a `$ref` property. If necessary, wrap the `$ref` in an `allOf`.

## [0.6.1] - 2019-12-09
### Fixed:
- Fix a compile error that can occur when deriving `JsonSchema` from a project that doesn't reference serde_json

## [0.6.0] - 2019-12-09
### Added:
- When deriving `JsonSchema`, the schema's `title` and `description` are now set from `#[doc]` comments (https://github.com/GREsau/schemars/issues/7)
- When deriving `JsonSchema` on structs using a `#[serde(default)]` attribute, the schema's properties will now include `default`, unless the default value is skipped by the field's `skip_serializing_if` function (https://github.com/GREsau/schemars/issues/6)
### Changed:
- When the `option_nullable` setting is enabled (e.g. for openapi 3), schemas for `Option<T>` will no longer inline `T`'s schema when it should be referenceable.

## [0.5.1] - 2019-10-30
### Fixed:
- Added missing doc comment for `title` schema property

## [0.5.0] - 2019-10-30
### Added:
- Implemented `JsonSchema` for more standard library types (https://github.com/GREsau/schemars/issues/3)
### Changed:
- Unsigned integer types (usize, u8 etc.) now have their [`minimum`](https://json-schema.org/draft/2019-09/json-schema-validation.html#rfc.section.6.2.4) explicitly set to zero
- Made prepositions/conjunctions in generated schema names lowercase
    - e.g. schema name for `Result<MyStruct, Vec<String>>` has changed from "Result_Of_MyStruct_Or_Array_Of_String" to "Result_of_MyStruct_or_Array_of_String"
- Some provided `JsonSchema` implementations with the same `type` but different `format`s (e.g. `i8` and `usize`) used the `type` as their name. They have now been updated to use `format` as their name.
    - Previously, schema generation would incorrectly assume types such as `MyStruct<i8>` and `MyStruct<usize>` were identical, and give them a single schema definition called `MyStruct_for_Integer` despite the fact they should have different schemas. Now they will each have their own schema (`MyStruct_for_i8` and `MyStruct_for_usize` respectively).
