# Changelog

## [0.6.0] - TBD
### Added:
- When deriving `JsonSchema`, the schema's `title` and `description` are now set from `#[doc]` comments (https://github.com/GREsau/schemars/issues/7)
### Changed:
- When the `option_nullable` setting is enabled (e.g. for openapi 3), schemas for `Option<T>` will no longer inline `T`'s schema when it should be referenceable.

## [0.5.1] - 2019-10-30
### Fixed:
- Added missing doc comment for "title" schema property

## [0.5.0] - 2019-10-30
### Added:
- Implemented `JsonSchema` for more standard library types (https://github.com/GREsau/schemars/issues/3)
### Changed:
- Unsigned integer types (usize, u8 etc.) now have their [`minimum`](https://json-schema.org/draft/2019-09/json-schema-validation.html#rfc.section.6.2.4) explicitly set to zero
- Made prepositions/conjunctions in generated schema names lowercase
    - e.g. schema name for `Result<MyStruct, Vec<String>>` has changed from "Result_Of_MyStruct_Or_Array_Of_String" to "Result_of_MyStruct_or_Array_of_String"
- Some provided `JsonSchema` implementations with the same `type` but different `format`s (e.g. `i8` and `usize`) used the `type` as their name. They have now been updated to use `format` as their name.
    - Previously, schema generation would incorrectly assume types such as `MyStruct<i8>` and `MyStruct<usize>` were identical, and give them a single schema definition called `MyStruct_for_Integer` despite the fact they should have different schemas. Now they will each have their own schema (`MyStruct_for_i8` and `MyStruct_for_usize` respectively).
