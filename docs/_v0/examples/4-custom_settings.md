# Custom Schema Settings

The `gen` module allows you to customise how schemas are generated. For example, the default behaviour for `Option<T>` is to include `null` in the schema's `type`s, but we can instead add a `nullable` property to its schema:

{% include example_v0.md name="custom_settings" %}
